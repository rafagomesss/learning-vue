# import/no-relative-packages

ðŸ”§ This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent importing packages through relative paths.

It's useful in Yarn/Lerna workspaces, were it's possible to import a sibling
package using `../package` relative path, while direct `package` is the correct one.

+(fixable) The `--fix` option on the [command line] automatically fixes problems reported by this rule.
